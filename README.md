# Truck-Information-API
Can modify (add/delete) and check for specific trucks based on input details
This is a logistics based API created using Java Spring Boot framework which implements different functionalities like GET (to get list of loads with a particular ID), PUT (update load details for a particular load, identified by the load id), POST (add a new load to the existing list of loads) and DELETE (to delete a load with a particular ID as parameter).
I created this with the vision of helping users automate the processes of freight transportation, with much less hassle than it involves in the whole process, currently.
